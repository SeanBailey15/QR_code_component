## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

I feel like this project helped me learn a little more about using flex in CSS. CSS has been a weak point for me throughout my learning process, as I don't typically have extra time to practice and research.

### Continued development

I would like to continue to get better and more comfortable in all facets of web developement. I am still very early in my learning journey, and can only study and practice when life affords me the opportunities. Bit by bit, challenge by challenge, I hope to become a competent developer.
